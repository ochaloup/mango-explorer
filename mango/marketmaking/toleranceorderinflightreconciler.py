# # ðŸ¥­ ToleranceOrderInFlightReconciler class
#
# Has a level of 'tolerance' around whether a desired order matches an existing order.
#
# There are two tolerance levels:
# * A tolerance for price matching
# * A tolderance for quantity matching
#
# Tolerances are expressed as a ratio. To match the existing value must be within +/- the tolderance
# of the desired value.
#
# Note:
# * A BUY only matches with a BUY, a SELL only matches with a SELL.
# * ID and Client ID are ignored when matching.
# * ModelState is ignored when matching.
#
# Differes from ToleranceOrderReconciler by taking into account inflight orders
# and by either canceling all orders and creating new ones or doing nothing.
#

    This is a special purpose class, that will be replaced/deleted in a moment

    This class assumes that we do not know what we have in book, we only know
    what might be in the book. (Everything we have send in the last few moments)

    When any order that might be in book deviates from desired orders we want to cancel all
    and create all new.
